**_Climate Transition Risk and ESG Sentiment Impact on Stock Markets_**

This project investigates how climate transition risks and ESG sentiment influence stock market stability across European and American markets using high-frequency data. It applies advanced time series modeling techniquesâ€”including TVP-VAR and Quantile Coherencyâ€”to uncover the transmission of financial instability during periods of negative sentiment and market downturns.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- Climate transition risks have a strong impact on European stock markets, with ESG sentiment acting as a key driver of market reactions.
- Positive ESG sentiment contributes to market value during stable periods but loses its stabilizing effect under financial distress.
- Negative ESG sentiment intensifies the adverse effects of climate transition risks, worsening market downturns across both normal and crisis conditions.
- Time-Varying Parameter VAR (TVP-VAR) and Quantile Coherency models reveal the dynamic role of ESG sentiment in transmitting financial risk.
- Comparative results highlight that ESG-related uncertainty destabilizes U.S. stock markets more significantly than European ones.
